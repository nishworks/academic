I am in the process of cleaning my github account and removing junk code. I have taken down my repositories for the moment.
I am refactoring my code into library code and changing the context of my hobby projects into Tutorials.
Please stay tuned for weekly updates to the account with tutorials and new projects.
This repository contains some of the academic projects I did during my Master's at University of Texas.

Detailed information related to execution, compilation and general code explainations are in the respective README.md of each project.

'assessment' is only a temporary directory, will be removed soon.
